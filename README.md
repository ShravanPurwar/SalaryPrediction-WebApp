# Salary Prediction Project
## Define problem
In job posting websites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Indeed, each post lists its required skills, education, qualification, experience, ..., and of course, salary. 
* For applicants, instead of accepting the salary employer proposed, having an estimator predicting the salary based on job requirements or skills acquired gives confidence of their worth for further negotiation. 
* For employer, an salary estimator suggests a market standard so employers can propose a reasonable salary to attract more applicates. 

The goal of this project is to create a model that estimates a salary given jobs with various of requirements.
